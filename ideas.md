## Create Note and Canvas Mixed
We can build a new Menu Item for our BlockNote Editor that show the option "Canvas" and then, when we create a Canvas on a Note it shows a button that can be dragged and dropped that says "Open Canvas" and the user can edit the text of this button, when we click, it opens the Canvas for that part of the note, it can make easier for users who study things that have both, a lot of texts and "drawnings".
